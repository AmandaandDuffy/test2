                    Duffy has two Mickey Mouse features, similarly shaped face and hip Mickey birthmark.</span> Duffy is unique among Disney characters in that he was not first featured in a Disney movie or TV show until he made his television debut in the 2010 Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade. And on June 30, 2020, the Disney Parks posted on YouTube a stop motion short called "Morning Glories" featuring Duffy and Friends and then again in 2021 with another stop motion short called "Spring Surprise".</p>

                     <span class="highlight">So one day, Minnie decided to make a special teddy bear for Mickey. She also made a bottle with a letter that said "I hope this bear gives you happiness and luck!". She placed everything in a duffel bag. When Mickey got his present, he was very happy and decided to name the bear Duffy.
                     That night while he was asleep, Mickey had a dream that Duffy came to life dressed up as a sailor and said to him, "Mickey, let's go on adventures together!".</span> The next day when Mickey woke up, the bear looked exactly like he had in the dream! Mickey swears, even to this day, that when he turned around, the bear winked at him.
                      Mickey didn't feel lonely anymore and went on many adventures with Duffy, taking photos everywhere.
